- how do you distinguish between an invalid version and a version that simply has no vulnerabilities?
- i'm assuming that, as in the real word, package names are case-sensitive. i'm also assuming that, as is not always true
in the real world, that we trust the integrity of our licenses + vulnerabilities data.
